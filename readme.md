# AWSary is a AWS Dictionary iOS App

I've registered [AWSary.com](https://AWSary.com) that don't have any content yet but will eventually be the backend for this app developed on AWS.

I plan to develop this mobile app (maybe also a web app) using AWS as a backend and document all the processes on video streaming/tutorials so that new developers can learn how to use AWS.

You can open issues with ideas for features or bugs on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tigpt/awsary-ios).

You can beta test the TestFlight app on the [link](TODO) while it's not on the AppStore.

Thanks for your interest in AWSary.com let's help more people learn about AWS.
