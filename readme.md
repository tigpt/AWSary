# AWSary is a AWS Dictionary iOS App


![AWSary Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigpt/AWSary/main/ios/logo/icon-logo_152_color.png)

You can find the app on [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/awsary-aws-dictionary/id1634871091?uo=2)

I've registered `AWSary.com` that don't have any content yet but will eventually be the backend for this app on AWS.

You can open issues with ideas for features or bugs on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tigpt/awsary-ios).

Thank you for your support and looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Here's to making AWS a little less intimidating! ðŸ¥‚
